title: "About This Blog"

Once midterm season is over, I aim to update this blog. This space is where I’ll share those in-between moments: what I’m reading, what I’m questioning, and what research looks like behind the scenes. If science is about understanding how minds work, then this blog is about understanding how my thinking evolves along the way.
